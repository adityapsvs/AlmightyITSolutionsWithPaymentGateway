      <span align="center" style="background: white; font-size: 20px">FAQ:</span>
      <div style="background: white; font-size: 15px">
        <p>1. My computer does not turn on, what do I do now?</p>
        <p>A: First check the computer's power cord to make sure it is completely plugged into the wall socket. If you are using a plug strip, make sure it is completely plugged into the wall socket and that the power switch on the plug strip is turned on. Some plug strips also have a built in circuit breaker which usually looks like a black or red button near the power switch. Press the button to reset it and see if that solves the problem.
        </p>
        <p>2. What do I do when my computer crashes?</p>
        <p>A: There are many reasons why a computer may just stop working or "freeze". Most of the time there isn't much we can do about it, it is a fact of life that computer programs have become so complex that occasionally users will experience problems even when performing common tasks. When your computer no longer responds to keyboard commands your best bet is to re-boot the computer.
        </p>
        <p>3. What do I do if my hard disk fails to work?</p>
        <p>A: As with most computer errors, your first step is to shut down your computer and restart it. This will help you confirm weather or not you actually have a hard disk problem. If the disk is severely damaged then your computer will probably fail to restart properly. If this is the case then contact MC Ware, this is a job for the professionals.
        </p>
        <p>4. There is no display on the monitor, what do I do now?</p>
        <p>
          A: Make sure the monitor is on. If no power light (green or orange light) is seen on the monitor display try pressing the power button until it comes on. If your computer monitor was on and you stepped away from the computer and upon returning it was black it's likely that the computer is asleep. Try moving your mouse, clicking the mouse buttons, and/or pressing any key (space bar) on the keyboard to wake it up. Make sure that the monitor is connected properly to the back of the computer.
        </p>
        <p>5. I get a 'no signal input' message, what do I do?</p>
        <p>
          A: Verify that the monitor is properly connected in the back of the monitor as well as to the back of the computer. If the monitor appears to be connected properly, verify that a cable is not loose by disconnecting all cables that can be disconnected in the back of the monitor (generally the data cable cannot be disconnected). Next, disconnect the data cable connected to the back of the computer and then reconnect the cable. When connecting the cable in the back of the computer ensure the cable connection is tight. Most Computers will also have screw ends that can be screwed in to hold the connector in place.
        </p>
        <p>6. How can I recover a file from the recycle bin?</p>
        <p>
          A: Double click the recycle bin icon on your desktop, here you will see all of the files within your bin. Select the files you wish to recover, right click and choose restore.
        </p>
        <p>7. I am unable to send or receive email?</p>
        <p>
          A: Verify that your computer is able to see the Internet and/or other computers to ensure that your computer is not encountering a connection issue, which would be causing your e-mail issue. Ensure that your Internet e-mail server or your Network e-mail server is not encountering issues by contacting either your Internet Service Provider or your Network administrator.
        </p>
        <p>8. I can't receive any email attachments?</p>
        <p>
          A: If the e-mail box is full of other e-mail messages and/or your storage space is only a few megabytes it's possible that the attachment being sent cannot be received. Often if this problem is occurring the person sending the e-mail should get a response back from your e-mail server indicating that your mailbox is full and/or has exceeded its allocated size. Because computer viruses and other malware are best distributed through e-mail, many e-mail service providers, companies, and e-mail programs prevent certain types of file extensions from being distributed or received through e-mail. For example, Microsoft Outlook protect its users by automatically disabling certain file extension types from being received in e-mail.
        </p>
        <p>9. My printer is printing smudged/distorted pages?</p>
        <p>
          A: When printing on untraditional paper your printer may experience smudges, un-even or crooked text, and/or text that runs off the edges of the paper. Your printer may be printing fuzzy, blurry, and/or other faint text because of dirty print heads. All modern printers have some type of printer cleaning, self-test, and/or diagnose mode that can be performed to check and clean the printers print heads and other internal equipment used to print.
        </p>
        <p>10. How do I fix a paper jam?</p>
        <p>
          A: Turn off the printer. Inspect the location or tray the printed paper ejects to. If the stuck paper is visible manually remove it. Remove all paper trays and any paper that may be stuck between the tray and the printer. If the stuck paper is visible manually remove it. Open the printer door that allows you access to the printer ink cartridges or toner and look for any stuck paper. If the stuck paper is visible manually remove it. Turn the printer back on.
        </p>
        <p>11. I can't connect to my network drive anymore?</p>
        <p>
          A: Verify that the network cable is properly connected to the back of the computer. In addition, when checking the connection of the network cable, ensure that the LED's on the network are properly illuminated. For example, a network card with a solid green LED or light usually indicates that the card is either connected or receiving a signal. Note: generally, when the green light is flashing, this is an indication of data being sent or received.
        </p>
        <p>12. How do I determine my computer's name?</p>
        <p>
          A: Right-click My Computer. Click Properties. In the Properties window, click the Computer Name tab. Within this tab you'll be able to see the full computer name, workgroup and also a description. If you wish to change the name or workgroup, click the Change button.
        </p>
        <p>13. What is a computer virus?</p>
        <p>A: A computer virus is a software program that has been intentionally created to cause a user grief, spread to other computers, or destroy data on an individual's computer. To help prevent a computer from becoming infected by a virus, software developers have developed anti virus programs that stay active on the computer helping to protect it. It is important to realize that many computers do not come pre-loaded with these already installed and that if computers do come with these programs, the programs may expire within 90 days.
        </p>
        <p>14. Does Windows come with a virus protection program?</p>
        <p>
          A: All versions of Microsoft Windows do not come pre-installed with a virus protection program. This includes: Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista.
        </p>
        <p>15. Can a virus damage computer hardware?</p>
        <p>
          A: No. Computer viruses are software code designed to spread to computer files and other computers, delete files, and cause other problems with the data on the computer. So if you're experiencing an issue with a hardware device such as your printer, video card, sound card, etc. it is not due to a virus.
        </p>
        <p>16. If I format or erase my hard drive will it remove a virus?</p>
        <p>
          A: If your computer is infected with a virus formatting or erasing the hard disk drive and starting over will almost always remove any type of virus. However, keep in mind if backups have been made that contain the virus, other media or drives connected to the computer have a virus, your computer is connected to another computer on a network with a virus, and/or the virus is stored on some other type of software you use with your computer it can become re-infected if not properly protected.

      <span align="center" style="background: white; font-size: 20px">SHIPPING POLICIES:</span>
      <div style="background: white; font-size: 15px">
        <p>This kind of purchase should be treated like any other sale to a foreign customer. It generally is the responsibility of the customer/importer to declare their purchase and pay any taxes. In addition to immediate delivery, “shipping” (downloading) software via the Internet offers tax and tariff advantages. When software is delivered electronically, it is considered an “intangible” export, which does not have a corresponding Schedule B code, meaning import tariffs cannot be assessed by foreign Customs (although there still may be other taxes and duties levied). Intangible exports of software also do not require an EEI, even if an export license is required. This is the case, for example, for software demos and updates. Since a software demo has no commercial value, an EEI is not required. It is worth pointing out, however, that some countries impose a restriction on the complexity of the demo and the amount of time a demo product can remain in their country. Software updates do not require an EEI for electronic delivery, regardless of value. An EEI is still required if an update is mailed (on a disc, etc.)

      <span align="center" style="background: white; font-size: 20px">EXPORT RESTRICTIONS AND REGULATIONS:</span>
      <div style="background: white; font-size: 15px">
        <p>Export controls are meant to promote national security, support foreign policy, and carry out international obligations. The U.S. Departments of State, Treasury, and Commerce each have their own lists of denied parties, and maintain independent systems of export controls. The intention of the federal government is not to hinder international trade, but to control sales of software and other information products that may be used against U.S.national interests.
